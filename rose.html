<p>Some say, <strong>"Love. It is a river<br>
That drowns the tender reed."</strong><br>
Some say, <u>"Love. It is a razor<br>
That leaves your soul to bleed."</u><br>
Some say, "Love. It is a hunger,<br>
An endless aching need."<br>
I say, "Love. It is a flower,<br>
And you its only seed."</p>

That never learns to dance.<br>
It's the dream afraid of waking<br>
That never takes the chance.<br>
It's the one who won't be taken,<br>
Who cannot seem to give,<br>
And the soul afraid of dyin'<br>
That never learns to live.</p>

Lies the seed that with the sun's love<br>
In the spring becomes <a href="https://www.voakorea.com/a/article----the-rose-by-bette-midler--152059125/1368054.html" target="_blank" title="Interpretation">the rose.</a></p>

<h1>Bread - if</h1>
<p>If a picture paints a thousand words<br>
Then why can't I paint you?<br>
The words will never show<br>
The you I've come to know</p>

<p>If a face could launch a thousand ships<br>
Then where am I to go?<br>
There's no one home but you<br>
You're all that's left me too<br>
And when my love for life is running dry<br>
You come and pour yourself on me</p>

<p>If a man could be two places at one time<br>
I'd be with you<br>
Tomorrow and today<br>
Beside you all the way</p>

<p>If the world should stop revolving<br>
Spinning slowly down to die<br>
I'd spend the end with you<br>
And when the world was through<br>
Then one by one the stars would all go out<br>
Then you and I would simply fly away</p>

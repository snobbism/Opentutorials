<h1>Nat King Cole - L-O-V-E</h1>
<p>L, is for the way you look at me<br>
O, is for the only one I see<br>
V, is very very, extraordinary<br>
E, is even more than anyone that you adore</p>

<p>And love<br>
Is all that I can give, to you<br>
Love, is more than just a game, for two<br>
Two, in love can make it<br>
Take my heart, and please don't break it<br>
Love, was made for me and you</p>
